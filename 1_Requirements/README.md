# SWOT Analysis


# 4W's & 1H
* **What**  : Windscreen wipers are necessary for maintaining sufficient view for the driver, especially in modern high-speed cars.
* **When**  : The windshield wipers remove rain and snow from the windshield, while the headlights improve visibility at night.
* **Where** : It can be incorporated in car, trucks, etc
* **Why**   : To keep the windscreen clean enough to give adequate view at all times.  
* **How**   : By using STM32F407VG microprocessor
