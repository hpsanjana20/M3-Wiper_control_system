Wiper is an essential component that is used to wipe raindrops or any water from the vehicleâ€™s windscreen. The previous system used to activate the wiper manually and the process of pulling up the wiper is difficult to be handled. Thus, this system is proposed to solve these problems. 

The objectives of this project are to upgrade the older cars system by providing automatic wiping system, to improve the system by using sensor with actuator and to design a basic program that will fully operate with the system.

The concept of this proposed wiper system is similar with other existing conventional wiper. In spite of removing water from windscreen, this system also will be upgraded to an automatic control system by using a Peripheral Interface Controller and water sensor. 

The wiper system functions well according to the water condition from the outside of a car. This project showed a contribution on the design of the automatic wiper system for the future research in this same field.
